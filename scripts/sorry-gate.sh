# Repo sorry gate.
#
# The check is the compiler's own AST-level diagnostic, never a source grep.
# Lean reports a declaration whose proof term contains `sorryAx` as
#
#   <file>:<line>:<col>: warning: declaration uses `sorry`
#
# with message kind `hasSorry` (verified against Lean 4.30.0 via `lean --json`).
# A `sorry` written in a comment, a docstring or a string literal produces no
# such message, and a declaration that reaches `sorryAx` through a tactic the
# text search would not match still produces one. That is the whole reason this
# gate reads the compiler's output rather than the sources.
#
# CI documentation elsewhere in this repo quotes
# `lake build <module> -- --run-linter=sorryIn`. Lean 4.30.0 has no
# `--run-linter` flag and Lake 5 has no `--` argument forwarding on `build`
# (checked against `lean --help`, `lake help build` and `lake help lint`; the
# package configures no `lintDriver`), so that command does not run a linter.
# `hasSorry` is the mechanism that does.
#
# ## Coverage
#
# The diagnostic is produced when a module is ELABORATED, and replayed from the
# build log when a module is served from cache. So this gate covers exactly the
# modules the surrounding build reaches — no more. Here CI wraps
# `CatCrypt.Crypto.EasyCryptImport.All`, which is the whole package.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   scripts/sorry-gate.sh run <command...>   run <command>, appending its
#                                            combined output to the gate log,
#                                            and propagate its exit status
#   scripts/sorry-gate.sh check              scan the gate log and ratchet
#   scripts/sorry-gate.sh --scan <log>...    scan explicit log files
#   scripts/sorry-gate.sh --init [<log>...]  write the baseline (once)
#   scripts/sorry-gate.sh --reset            truncate the gate log
#
# BOOTSTRAP: `check` FAILS while scripts/sorry-baseline.txt is absent. Run a
# build covering the CI target set, then `--init`, review the result, and commit
# it. The baseline is deliberately not self-initializing — see the comment at
# the `[ ! -f "$BASELINE" ]` branch for why that would make the gate vacuous.
#
# `run` is a pass-through: it never changes the command's exit status, so a
# build failure still reports as a build failure. The gate's pass/fail decision
# comes from `check`.
#
# ## Ratchet
#
# `scripts/sorry-baseline.txt` records, per source file, how many `sorry`
# declarations that file is currently allowed to have. The gate FAILS when a
# file's count rises or a file not in the baseline acquires one, and rewrites
# the baseline downward when counts fall (the git check in CI then fails if the
# tightened baseline was left uncommitted — the same shape as the other
# ratchets in this directory).
#
# Positions are deliberately NOT recorded. A baseline keyed on line numbers
# churns on every unrelated edit above a sorry, which trains reviewers to
# rubber-stamp its diff.
#
# Env:
#   SORRY_GATE_LOG   gate log path (default .lake/sorry-gate.log)

# The text Lean emits for a `hasSorry` diagnostic. The severity appears on
# either side of the position depending on who prints it: `lean` writes
#   <file>:<line>:<col>: warning: declaration uses `sorry`
# and Lake writes
#   warning: <file>:<line>:<col>: declaration uses `sorry`
# so the pattern anchors on the message alone, which no other diagnostic emits.
# Anchoring on `(warning|error): declaration uses` instead matched only the first
# form, and Lake's is the one a `lake build` log actually contains.
